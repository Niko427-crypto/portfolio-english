                                Hi there! I'm SaraeVin, an 18-year-old English major passionate about literature and language. I’m driven not by the pursuit of fame or fortune, but by a deep desire to honor the love and belief that my parents and my boyfriend, Shin, have always given me. They have shaped the person I am today, and my journey is all about giving back to them through my work, my words, and my actions. 
                                <img src="../imgs/aboutImgs/fishTankImg.jpg" class="rb-about-img fish-about-img" alt="">
                                From a young age, I’ve been captivated by the power of language. Whether it’s through reading novels, writing essays, or engaging in meaningful conversations, I find joy in the way words can connect, inspire, and transform. I believe that language is more than just a tool—it’s a bridge that brings people together and a force that can change the world.
                                In my studies, I strive to not only excel academically but also to make a difference in the lives of others. I’ve volunteered to tutor younger students and have helped create spaces for others to explore the world of literature through book clubs. I truly believe in the transformative power of stories, and I’m dedicated to sharing that love with anyone who’s willing to listen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My relationship with my boyfriend, Shin, is a cornerstone of my life. He’s not only an expert in cybersecurity but also my greatest support. When I’m feeling overwhelmed or tired, Shin is the one who reminds me of my strength and encourages me to keep going. His belief in me keeps me grounded, and I’m incredibly grateful to have him by my side.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In everything I do, I aim to live with intention and purpose. I’m not chasing accolades or material success—I’m simply trying to live a life that reflects the love and belief that others have shown me. I want to be a source of kindness, support, and inspiration to those around me, just as my family and Shin have been to me.
                                Thank you for visiting my profile. I look forward to connecting with others who share the same values of growth, purpose, and making a meaningful impact on the world.
