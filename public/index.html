                                    This essay explores the origin and significance of a belief shaped by various journeys and battles with mental health. 
                                    It examines the challenges posed by societal expectations, mental well-being, and the evolution of self-perception. 
                                    Using metaphors of paintings, it illustrates a journey of self-love and acceptance.

                                    "Growth and Fixed Mindsets: Exploring Their Relation to Neurodiversity" explores the concept of Dr. Carol 
                                    Dweck's mindset theory and whether or not it can fairly and accurately be applied to not only 
                                    neurodiverse individuals, but all persons with disabilities. As an exploratory essay with a 
                                    delayed thesis, two questions were introduced in the beginning and were continuously explored
                                    throughout the summaries of multiple sources and the responses to them.

                                I'm SaraeVin, an 18-year-old English major passionate about literature and language. I’m driven not by the pursuit of fame or fortune, but by a deep desire to honor the love and belief that my parents and my boyfriend, Shin, have always given me. They have shaped the person I am today, and my journey is all about giving back to them through my work, my words, and my actions.

                                From a young age, I’ve been captivated by the power of language. Whether it’s through reading novels, writing essays, or engaging in meaningful conversations, I find joy in the way words can connect, inspire, and transform. I believe that language is more than just a tool—it’s a bridge that brings people together and a force that can change the world.

                                In everything I do, I aim to live with intention and purpose. I’m not chasing accolades or material success—I’m simply trying to live a life that reflects the love and belief that others have shown me. I want to be a source of kindness, support, and inspiration to those around me, just as my family and Shin have been to me.
